        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Vo Hoang Anh, and I am from Vietnam, <abbr title="South East Asia">SEA</abbr> . I have had the privilege of residing in Canada for the past five years, with the last one and a half years spent in the charming city of Ottawa. While Canada has become my 2<sup>nd</sup> home, I am still acclimating to the colder climate.</p>

        <p>Throughout my journey, I have had the opportunity to call several cities across the globe my temporary homes, including <em>Sydney, Queenstown, Auckland, Niagara Falls, Montreal</em>, and, of course, <em>Ottawa</em>. Despite its small size, Ottawa captivates me with its innate beauty, diverse offerings, and has firmly secured its place as one of my most cherished places to live.</p>
